## Mechanisms of positive plant interactions.
The aim of this study was to conceptualize the mechanistic pathways of the nurse-plant syndrome by life-form and to identify the implications of positive plant–plant interactions forlandscape and evolutionary ecology. It is becoming
increasingly apparent that future studies of the nurse-plant syndrome must
decouple and consider multiple mechanisms of interaction to explain the processes
that influence community structure, particularly in high-stress conditions, given a changing climate and potential shifts in biodiversity.

The relative frequency of each ecological hypothesis and nurse mechanism tested per study was compared using Pearson's chi-squared tests. To contrast the frequencies of nurse mechanisms and ecological theories, we used a Pearson's chi-squared test and compared the proportion for each grouping with the resulting standardized residuals as post hoc tests

### Hypotheses & mechanisms tested
``` {r, nurse mechanism, echo=TRUE}


par(mfrow = c(1,2))

plot2 <- barplot(dat2, xlab="", xaxt="n", ylab="Number of Articles", cex.lab=1.4, cex.names=1.2)
axis(side=1, at=plot2, labels=FALSE)
text(plot2,par("usr")[3] - 3, srt = 45, adj = 1,labels=xlab2,xpd = TRUE)

plot1 <- barplot(dat1, xlab="", xaxt='n', ylim=c(0,100),  cex.lab=1.4, cex.names=1.2, legend.text=TRUE, args.legend= list(x=12, y=110, cex=0.8, legend=legend))
axis(side=1, at=plot1, labels=FALSE)
text(plot1,par("usr")[3] - 3, srt = 45, adj = 1,labels=xlab1,xpd = TRUE)

#chi-square and post-hoc
m3 <- chisq.test(Hypo)
m3
m3$stdres

m4 <- chisq.test(Mech)
m4
m4$stdres
```

We also separated the number of studies associated with each ecological hypothesis based on nurse life-form and conducted a Kruskal–Wallis test followed by post hoc multiple comparisons tests (pgirmess package in R). To determine if the proportion of nurse life-forms was similar between ecological hypotheses, each one was treated as a percentage of the total number of nurse-plant studies and a one-way ANOVA was conducted between life-forms. Tukey's honestly significant difference tests were used for these post hoc comparisons.
